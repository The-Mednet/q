# Product Requirements Document: SMTP Relay Load Balancing System

## Executive Summary & Objectives

### Overview
This PRD defines requirements for implementing intelligent load balancing across multiple email providers in Mednet's SMTP relay service. The feature will enable automatic domain selection for generic sender addresses while respecting rate limits and provider constraints.

### Business Objectives
- **Primary**: Enable seamless email distribution across multiple provider workspaces
- **Secondary**: Maximize email throughput while respecting provider rate limits
- **Tertiary**: Improve system resilience through intelligent failover and capacity management

### Success Criteria
- Support for generic domain routing (e.g., `brian@invite.com` â†’ multiple backends)
- 99.5% email delivery success rate with load balancing active
- <100ms overhead for domain selection decisions
- Zero configuration required for basic load balancing scenarios

## User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Personas

**1. Medical Platform Administrator**
- **Need**: Send transactional emails from branded domains without managing complex routing
- **Pain Point**: Manual management of provider quotas and failover scenarios
- **Value**: Automated load distribution with visibility into provider performance

**2. Email Campaign Manager**
- **Need**: Reliable bulk email delivery for medical conferences and announcements
- **Pain Point**: Provider quota exhaustion causing delivery failures
- **Value**: Intelligent capacity management across multiple providers

**3. Development Team**
- **Need**: Simple SMTP interface that abstracts provider complexity
- **Pain Point**: Complex provider-specific configuration and monitoring
- **Value**: Unified interface with automatic provider selection

### Core Use Cases

**UC1: Generic Domain Load Balancing**
```
GIVEN: User sends email from brian@invite.com
WHEN: System receives SMTP request
THEN: System automatically selects optimal workspace from configured providers
AND: Respects rate limits and provider health status
```

**UC2: Capacity-Based Routing**
```
GIVEN: Multiple workspaces configured for load balancing
WHEN: System evaluates routing options
THEN: Selects workspace with highest remaining capacity
AND: Considers both workspace and user-level limits
```

**UC3: Provider Failover**
```
GIVEN: Primary workspace reaches rate limit or fails health check
WHEN: System attempts to route email
THEN: Automatically selects next available workspace
AND: Maintains delivery attempt tracking across providers
```

## Functional Requirements

### Core Load Balancing Features

**FR4: Health-Based Filtering**
- System MUST exclude unhealthy workspaces from load balancing selection
- Health checks MUST include provider API connectivity and authentication status
- Failed workspaces MUST be automatically re-evaluated for health recovery

**FR5: Weighted Distribution**

- Non-load-balanced workspaces MUST operate exactly as before
- Migration MUST be opt-in with zero impact on existing configurations

## Technical Requirements & Architecture

### System Architecture Changes

**TR1: Load Balancing Engine**
```go
type LoadBalancer interface {
    SelectWorkspace(senderEmail string, pools []LoadBalancingPool) (*config.WorkspaceConfig, error)
    RecordSelection(workspaceID string, success bool)
    GetPoolStatus(poolID string) PoolStatus
}

type LoadBalancingPool struct {
    ID           string                 `json:"id"`
    Name         string                 `json:"name"`
    DomainPatterns []string             `json:"domain_patterns"`
    Workspaces   []PoolWorkspace        `json:"workspaces"`
    Strategy     SelectionStrategy      `json:"strategy"`
    Enabled      bool                   `json:"enabled"`
}

type PoolWorkspace struct {
    WorkspaceID string  `json:"workspace_id"`
    Weight      float64 `json:"weight"`
    Enabled     bool    `json:"enabled"`
}
```

**TR2: Selection Algorithms**
- **Capacity-Weighted**: Combines workspace weight with remaining capacity percentage
- **Round-Robin**: Cycles through healthy workspaces with weight consideration
- **Least-Used**: Selects workspace with lowest current usage percentage
- **Random-Weighted**: Random selection weighted by capacity and configuration

**TR3: Integration Points**
- Modify `workspace.Manager.GetWorkspaceForSender()` to support pool routing
- Enhance `WorkspaceAwareRateLimiter` to provide capacity metrics for selection
- Update SMTP server to use load balancing for eligible domains

### Database Schema Changes

**TR4: Load Balancing Tables**
```sql
CREATE TABLE load_balancing_pools (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain_patterns JSON NOT NULL,
    strategy ENUM('capacity_weighted', 'round_robin', 'least_used', 'random_weighted') DEFAULT 'capacity_weighted',
    enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE pool_workspaces (
    pool_id VARCHAR(255),
    workspace_id VARCHAR(255),
    weight DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 1.0,
    enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    PRIMARY KEY (pool_id, workspace_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (pool_id) REFERENCES load_balancing_pools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE load_balancing_selections (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    pool_id VARCHAR(255),
    workspace_id VARCHAR(255),
    sender_email VARCHAR(255),
    selected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    success BOOLEAN,
    capacity_score DECIMAL(5,4),
    INDEX idx_pool_workspace (pool_id, workspace_id),
    INDEX idx_selected_at (selected_at)

## Algorithm Design for Domain Selection

### Capacity-Weighted Selection Algorithm

**Algorithm Overview**
```go
func (lb *LoadBalancer) SelectWorkspace(senderEmail string, pool LoadBalancingPool) (*config.WorkspaceConfig, error) {
    // 1. Filter healthy workspaces
    healthyWorkspaces := lb.filterHealthyWorkspaces(pool.Workspaces)
    
    // 2. Calculate capacity scores
    candidates := []WorkspaceCandidate{}
    for _, ws := range healthyWorkspaces {
        capacity := lb.getWorkspaceCapacity(ws.WorkspaceID, senderEmail)
        if capacity.RemainingPercentage < ws.MinCapacityThreshold {
            continue // Skip if below threshold
        }
        
        score := ws.Weight * capacity.RemainingPercentage
        candidates = append(candidates, WorkspaceCandidate{
            Workspace: ws,
            Score:     score,
            Capacity:  capacity,
        })
    }
    
    // 3. Select using weighted random
    return lb.weightedRandomSelect(candidates)
}
```

**Capacity Calculation**
```go
type CapacityInfo struct {
    WorkspaceRemaining  int
    UserRemaining      int
    WorkspaceLimit     int
    UserLimit          int
    RemainingPercentage float64
    TimeToReset        time.Duration
}

func (lb *LoadBalancer) getWorkspaceCapacity(workspaceID, senderEmail string) CapacityInfo {
    wsSent, wsRemaining, wsReset := lb.rateLimiter.GetWorkspaceStatus(workspaceID)
    userSent, userRemaining, userReset := lb.rateLimiter.GetStatus(workspaceID, senderEmail)
    
    // Use the more restrictive limit
    effectiveRemaining := min(wsRemaining, userRemaining)
    effectiveLimit := min(wsRemaining + wsSent, userRemaining + userSent)
    
    return CapacityInfo{
        WorkspaceRemaining:  wsRemaining,
        UserRemaining:      userRemaining,
        RemainingPercentage: float64(effectiveRemaining) / float64(effectiveLimit),
        TimeToReset:        max(wsReset.Sub(time.Now()), userReset.Sub(time.Now())),
    }
}
```

### Fallback Strategies

**Strategy 1: Graceful Degradation**
- If no pool workspaces available, attempt direct domain mapping
- If direct mapping fails, use global fallback workspace
- Log selection failures for monitoring

**Strategy 2: Capacity Recovery**
- Monitor rate limit reset times for capacity planning
- Temporarily exclude workspaces approaching limits
- Re-evaluate excluded workspaces on rate limit reset
