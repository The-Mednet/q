Hi Dr. Ricotta,
I'm reaching out to invite you to join theMednet, a physician-only Q&A platform run by a multidisciplinary group of faculty and fellows. Our mission is to answer every doctor's question and connect you with expert subspecialists from top institutions like MGH, UCSF, Michigan, and Duke, addressing clinical scenarios not covered by UpToDate, PubMed, or guidelines.

Join with this customized link (please do not share):

Join over 37,000 physicians across internal medicine subspecialties and see why we have received grant funding from the NIH while earning up to 20 AMA PRA Category 1 Creditsâ„¢ annually through our partnership with the University of Chicago.
